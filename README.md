# UFOs

### Overview of the analysis:

The overview of this project is to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. In this project, we are building a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.
After the completion of the project, we will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on various criterias like the event date, city, state, country and shape.

### Results:
The expected end result for the project was for the visitors to be able to conduct a simple search on the website by using different criterias. The pictures below shows that it was successful.
#### Home Screen for the Webpage

Here we can enter different values in any of the boxes on the left to get some values on the table to the right.

#### Search by City Name

In this example, we typed the name of the city in the "Enter a City" box, benton, and we can see that we have 1 record ont he right for that city. Similarly, the next emaples below will be conducting a search by shape and state.

#### Search by Shape

#### Search by State

So, we can see that the webpage has a simplified method of conducting searches that make retrieving data very efficient.

### Summary:
One drawback of the site is that the search boxes are case sensitive, and if the input does not matches the items that already exists on the list, will not return any results .
Two additional recommendations:
1. A drop down option for the search boxes.
2. A button to clear out the inputs in the boxes.
